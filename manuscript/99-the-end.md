# Now It's Your Turn

I showed a very opinionated way of doing continuous delivery and continuous deployment using Jenkins X in a Kubernetes cluster. Unlike the **The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit: Continuous Deployment To Kubernetes**, this time opinionation did not come from me, but rather the platform itself. Unlike the "traditional" Jenkins, Jenkins X has opinions how you should do continuous delivery or continuous deployment. Those opinions can be tweaked, but you do need to comply with some, if not all, of its processes. GitOps, for example, is a must. Without it, you'd loose too many of the great features it offers.

At the time of this writing (August 2019), Jenkins X is still in its early phases and we can expect great new features coming out. I'll do my best to keep this book up-to-date. For that reason, I hope you bought the eBook edition so that you can download updated versions. If you did, please keep in mind that I am in full control only of the editions in LeanPub.com and Amazon. I do not control other vendors so I cannot guarantee whether they will upload more recent versions.

Assuming that you did not skip directly to this section, you read everything I know about Jenkins X, at least until a new feature comes along and I update the book. Now its up to you to implement it in your organization and put it to the only real test by running it in production. That is, if I managed to convince you that Jenkins X is the best way to implement continuous delivery inside your Kubernetes clusters.

That being said, I'd love to get your point of view. Are you using Jenkins X? Did you create a custom build pack? How did you onboard teams? Any information about the way you use it and your experience with Jenkins X will help us improve the projecct. Please send me what you created. I want to see your processes and your pipelines. Even more, I'd love to work with you to publish them in a blog or as an appendix to this book. If you think you did something interesting, as I'm sure you did, please contact me on [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack and show me what you created. **You learned from others, now it's time for others to learn from you.**

**I'm done explaining what I did, now it's your turn to share what you made.**

# Contributions

Like the previous books, this one was also a collaboration effort. Many helped shape this book through discussions, notes, and bug reports. I was swarmed with comments through [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/) Slack (often private) messages and emails. The conversations I had with the readers of the early editions of the book influenced the end result significantly. I'm grateful to have such a great community behind me. **Thank you for helping me make this book great.**

A few rose above the crowd.

**Carlos Sanchez** was so kind to contribute parts of the **Choosing The Right Deployment Strategy** chapter. He's one of those people that you MUST follow on social media. His articles are great and he is one of the most gifted speakers I ever saw.

**Joost van der Griendt** is one of those people that embrace a challenge wholeheartedly. We worked together for the same customer and quickly established a great relationship. From there on, he started helping me with discussions and advice on the subjects I worked on. Later on, he began contributing to this book. At times he was so proactive and helpful that I could not keep up with his pull requests. Just when I would think that I'm done for the day, I'd see a new pull request with more questions, changes, additions, and corrections.

In his own words...

*Joost started out a Java backend developer but found himself fascinated by developer productivity through tools like Jenkins and Maven. Inspired by Viktor's books and Workshops, he moved his attention to Docker, Cloud, and DevOps to the point where he joined CloudBees to help spread the knowledge.*

**Darin Pope** was continually sending pull requests with corrections and suggestions. He made this book much clearer than it would be if I had to rely on my, often incorrect, assumptions of what readers expect. Without him, my "broken" English would be even more evident. Outside of the help with this book, we're hosting together[DevOps Paradox podcast](https://www.devopsparadox.com). Please check it out.
